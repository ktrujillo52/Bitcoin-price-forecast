# Bitcoin-price-forecast
2 Hidden Markov Models are used to guide Monte Carlo simulation. The data is analyzed with Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering. The best forecast will need to be selected based on heuristics.
## Requirements
Python
## Usage
Please ensure you have the following directory structure and replace the path variables at the top of each python script:
```
Date
|-- data                #contains input data and will contain csv data generated from HMM and Monte Carlo simulation
    |-- bitcoin.csv     #input data
|-- png                 #plots generated from HMM and Monte Carlo simulation
|-- pca_csv             #Contains scaled simulation data
|-- pca_png             #Principal Component Analysis plots
```
To submit a job please ensure all scripts are in the same directory and run the following command:
```
bash submit.sh
```

A dendrogram will appear and the nearest-neighbor to 'bitcoin.csv' will be the best forecast from the simulations.
